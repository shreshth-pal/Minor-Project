# Minor-Project
---->Input :Concentration and Rate of Reaction
---->Output:Best Fitting Curve
Steps
1.Getting Vmax and Km values through linearization of scattered data using Linear Regression
2.Drawing three curves 
      Lineweaver Burk
      Eadee-Hofstee
      Langmuir Plot
3. From these curves we get three Vmax and three Km
4. These form 9 pairs of possible Vmax and Km
5. Using Root Mean Square Error find the best fitting to Raw data
